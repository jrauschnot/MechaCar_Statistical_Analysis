# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

# Project Overview:
An analysis of car data using RStudio and R Console.

## Resources:

* Data Sources:

* Software: RStudios, R Console


## Results:
1. Linear Regression to Predict MPG:

As shown by the summary statistics below, we can address the following:

- The Intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance provided non-random variance to the MPG values in the dataset.

- The slope of the linear model is not zero (m =! 0) because the Intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance are significant and therefore not determined by random chance and error.

- The linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively because of the r-squared (r^2 = 0.7149) value or coefficient of determination is > 0.7 and the P-value is < 0.05.
